### Minimal Makefile âš¡
_Automatic Makefile for C and C++_
```
# build shared library with -fPIC, -shared
CFLAGS   = -g # -O3 -fPIC # CXXFLAGS for .cpp
LDFLAGS  = # -L../bar -Wl,-rpath,/foo/bar # -shared
LDLIBS   = # -lbar
CPPFLAGS = -MMD -MP # -I../bar
#CC      = $(CXX) # link with CXX for .cpp

# target name is basename of one of the source files
main : $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c)) # .cpp
-include *.d
clean : ; -rm -fr *.o *.d
.PHONY : clean
```
